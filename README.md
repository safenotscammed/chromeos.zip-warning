# chromeos.zip

If you clicked on chromeos.zip in a message or email someone sent you and ended up here instead of downloading a zip file, you might be wondering what's going on. Let me explain ...

Starting from May 2023, anyone can create a website ending in .zip. This can create confusion because some services automatically add clickable links when you enter a URL.

So if someone sends you an email or message and references chromeos.zip, their email or messaging service may automatically convert it into a clickable link. If you click it, it will take you here instead of downloading the file for you.

Bad actors can abuse this by creating malicious .zip websites in the hopes that users like you will go there by mistake. For example, they can create a site that automatically downloads malware, or they may try to trick you into entering your personal details.

So don't click on clickable file names unless you're absolutely sure you know where they go.

Stay safe out there!
